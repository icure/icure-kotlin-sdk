**notes** | [**kotlin.collections.List&lt;AnnotationDto&gt;**](AnnotationDto.md) | Comments - Notes recorded by a HCP about this service |
**qualifiedLinks** | **kotlin.collections.Map&lt;kotlin.String, kotlin.collections.Map&lt;kotlin.String, kotlin.String&gt;&gt;** | Links towards related services (possibly in other contacts) |
**codes** | [**kotlin.collections.Set&lt;CodeStubDto&gt;**](CodeStubDto.md) | A code is an item from a codification system that qualifies the content of this entity. SNOMED-CT, ICPC-2 or ICD-10 codifications systems can be used for codes |
