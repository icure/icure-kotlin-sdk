/**
 * This entity is a root level object. It represents a patient It is serialized in JSON and saved in the underlying icure-patient CouchDB database.
 *
 * @param id the Id of the patient. We encourage using either a v4 UUID or a HL7 Id.
 * @param tags A tag is an item from a codification system that qualifies an entity as being member of a certain class, whatever the value it might have taken. If the tag qualifies the content of a field, it means that whatever the content of the field, the tag will always apply. For example, the label of a field is qualified using a tag. LOINC is a codification system typically used for tags.
 * @param codes A code is an item from a codification system that qualifies the content of this entity. SNOMED-CT, ICPC-2 or ICD-10 codifications systems can be used for codes
 * @param languages the list of languages spoken by the patient ordered by fluency (alpha-2 code http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/ascii_8bits.html).
 * @param addresses the list of addresses (with address type).
 * @param mergedIds The ids of the patients that have been merged inside this patient.
 * @param active Is the patient active (boolean).
 * @param deactivationReason When not active, the reason for deactivation.
 * @param insurabilities List of insurance coverages (of class Insurability, see below).
 * @param partnerships List of partners, or persons of contact (of class Partnership, see below).
 * @param patientHealthCareParties Links (usually for therapeutic reasons) between this patient and healthcare parties (of class PatientHealthcareParty).
 * @param financialInstitutionInformation Financial information (Bank, bank account) used to reimburse the patient.
 * @param medicalHouseContracts Contracts between the patient and the healthcare entity.
 * @param patientProfessions Codified list of professions exercised by this patient.
 * @param parameters Extra parameters
 * @param properties Extra properties
 * @param hcPartyKeys For each couple of HcParties (delegator and delegate), this map contains the exchange AES key. The delegator is always this hcp, the key of the map is the id of the delegate. The AES exchange key is encrypted using RSA twice : once using this hcp public key (index 0 in the Array) and once using the other hcp public key (index 1 in the Array). For a pair of HcParties. Each HcParty always has one AES exchange key for himself.
 * @param privateKeyShamirPartitions The privateKeyShamirPartitions are used to share this hcp's private RSA key with a series of other hcParties using Shamir's algorithm. The key of the map is the hcp Id with whom this partition has been shared. The value is \"threshold⎮partition in hex\" encrypted using the the partition's holder's public RSA key
 * @param secretForeignKeys The secretForeignKeys are filled at the to many end of a one to many relationship (for example inside Contact for the Patient -> Contacts relationship). Used when we want to find all contacts for a specific patient. These keys are in clear. You can have several to partition the medical document space.
 * @param cryptedForeignKeys The secretForeignKeys are filled at the to many end of a one to many relationship (for example inside Contact for the Patient -> Contacts relationship). Used when we want to find the patient for a specific contact. These keys are the encrypted id (using the hcParty key for the delegate) that can be found in clear inside the patient. ids encrypted using the hcParty keys.
 * @param delegations When a document is created, the responsible generates a cryptographically random master key (never to be used for something else than referencing from other entities). He/she encrypts it using his own AES exchange key and stores it as a delegation. The responsible is thus always in the delegations as well
 * @param encryptionKeys When a document needs to be encrypted, the responsible generates a cryptographically random master key (different from the delegation key, never to appear in clear anywhere in the db. He/she encrypts it using his own AES exchange key and stores it as a delegation
 * @param nonDuplicateIds 
 * @param encryptedAdministrativesDocuments 
 * @param schoolingInfos 
 * @param employementInfos 
 * @param rev the revision of the patient in the database, used for conflict management / optimistic locking.
 * @param created The timestamp (unix epoch in ms) of creation of this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param modified The date (unix epoch in ms) of the latest modification of this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param author The id of the User that has created this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param responsible The id of the HealthcareParty that is responsible for this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param endOfLife Soft delete (unix epoch in ms) timestamp of the object.
 * @param deletionDate hard delete (unix epoch in ms) timestamp of the object. Filled automatically when deletePatient is called.
 * @param firstName the firstname (name) of the patient.

 * @param personalStatus any of `single`, `in_couple`, `married`, `separated`, `divorced`, `divorcing`, `widowed`, `widower`, `complicated`, `unknown`, `contract`, `other`.
 * @param dateOfBirth The birthdate encoded as a fuzzy date on 8 positions (YYYYMMDD) MM and/or DD can be set to 00 if unknown (19740000 is a valid date).
 * @param dateOfDeath The date of death encoded as a fuzzy date on 8 positions (YYYYMMDD) MM and/or DD can be set to 00 if unknown (19740000 is a valid date).
