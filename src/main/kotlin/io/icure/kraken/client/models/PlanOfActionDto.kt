/**
 * List of healthcare approaches.
 *
 * @param id 
 * @param tags A tag is an item from a codification system that qualifies an entity as being member of a certain class, whatever the value it might have taken. If the tag qualifies the content of a field, it means that whatever the content of the field, the tag will always apply. For example, the label of a field is qualified using a tag. LOINC is a codification system typically used for tags.
 * @param codes A code is an item from a codification system that qualifies the content of this entity. SNOMED-CT, ICPC-2 or ICD-10 codifications systems can be used for codes
 * @param status bit 0: active/inactive, bit 1: relevant/irrelevant, bit 2 : present/absent, ex: 0 = active,relevant and present
 * @param documentIds 
 * @param careTeamMemberships Members of the careteam involved in this approach
 * @param relevant 
 * @param created The timestamp (unix epoch in ms) of creation of this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param modified The date (unix epoch in ms) of the latest modification of this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param author The id of the User that has created this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param responsible The id of the HealthcareParty that is responsible for this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param medicalLocationId The id of the medical location where this entity was created.
 * @param endOfLife Soft delete (unix epoch in ms) timestamp of the object.
 * @param prescriberId The id of the hcp who prescribed this healthcare approach
 * @param valueDate The date (unix epoch in ms) when the healthcare approach is noted to have started and also closes on the same date
 * @param openingDate The date (unix epoch in ms) of the start of the healthcare approach.
 * @param closingDate The date (unix epoch in ms) marking the end of the healthcare approach.
 * @param deadlineDate The date (unix epoch in ms) when the healthcare approach has to be carried out.
 * @param name The name of the healthcare approach.
 * @param descr Description of the healthcare approach.
 * @param note Note about the healthcare approach.
 * @param idOpeningContact Id of the opening contact when the healthcare approach was created.
 * @param idClosingContact Id of the closing contact for the healthcare approach.
 * @param numberOfCares The number of individual cares already performed in the course of this healthcare approach
 * @param encryptedSelf The base64 encoded data of this object, formatted as JSON and encrypted in AES using the random master key from encryptionKeys.
