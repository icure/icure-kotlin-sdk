 * @param id
 * @param tags A tag is an item from a codification system that qualifies an entity as being member of a certain class, whatever the value it might have taken. If the tag qualifies the content of a field, it means that whatever the content of the field, the tag will always apply. For example, the label of a field is qualified using a tag. LOINC is a codification system typically used for tags.
 * @param codes A code is an item from a codification system that qualifies the content of this entity. SNOMED-CT, ICPC-2 or ICD-10 codifications systems can be used for codes
 * @param content
 * @param secretForeignKeys The secretForeignKeys are filled at the to many end of a one to many relationship (for example inside Contact for the Patient -> Contacts relationship). Used when we want to find all contacts for a specific patient. These keys are in clear. You can have several to partition the medical document space.
 * @param cryptedForeignKeys The secretForeignKeys are filled at the to many end of a one to many relationship (for example inside Contact for the Patient -> Contacts relationship). Used when we want to find the patient for a specific contact. These keys are the encrypted id (using the hcParty key for the delegate) that can be found in clear inside the patient. ids encrypted using the hcParty keys.
 * @param delegations When a document is created, the responsible generates a cryptographically random master key (never to be used for something else than referencing from other entities). He/she encrypts it using his own AES exchange key and stores it as a delegation. The responsible is thus always in the delegations as well
 * @param encryptionKeys When a document needs to be encrypted, the responsible generates a cryptographically random master key (different from the delegation key, never to appear in clear anywhere in the db. He/she encrypts it using his own AES exchange key and stores it as a delegation
 * @param rev
 * @param created The timestamp (unix epoch in ms) of creation of this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param modified The date (unix epoch in ms) of the latest modification of this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param author The id of the User that has created this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param responsible The id of the HealthcareParty that is responsible for this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param medicalLocationId The id of the medical location where this entity was created.
 * @param endOfLife Soft delete (unix epoch in ms) timestamp of the object.
 * @param deletionDate hard delete (unix epoch in ms) timestamp of the object. Filled automatically when deletePatient is called.
 * @param name
 * @param classification
 * @param encryptedSelf The base64 encoded data of this object, formatted as JSON and encrypted in AES using the random master key from encryptionKeys.
