/**
 * This entity is a root level object. It represents an Invoice. It is serialized in JSON and saved in the underlying iCure CouchDB database.
 *
 * @param id The Id of the Invoice. We encourage using either a v4 UUID or a HL7 Id.
 * @param tags A tag is an item from a codification system that qualifies an entity as being member of a certain class, whatever the value it might have taken. If the tag qualifies the content of a field, it means that whatever the content of the field, the tag will always apply. For example, the label of a field is qualified using a tag. LOINC is a codification system typically used for tags.
 * @param codes A code is an item from a codification system that qualifies the content of this entity. SNOMED-CT, ICPC-2 or ICD-10 codifications systems can be used for codes
 * @param invoicingCodes
 * @param receipts
 * @param options
 * @param secretForeignKeys The secretForeignKeys are filled at the to many end of a one to many relationship (for example inside Contact for the Patient -> Contacts relationship). Used when we want to find all contacts for a specific patient. These keys are in clear. You can have several to partition the medical document space.
 * @param cryptedForeignKeys The secretForeignKeys are filled at the to many end of a one to many relationship (for example inside Contact for the Patient -> Contacts relationship). Used when we want to find the patient for a specific contact. These keys are the encrypted id (using the hcParty key for the delegate) that can be found in clear inside the patient. ids encrypted using the hcParty keys.
 * @param delegations When a document is created, the responsible generates a cryptographically random master key (never to be used for something else than referencing from other entities). He/she encrypts it using his own AES exchange key and stores it as a delegation. The responsible is thus always in the delegations as well
 * @param encryptionKeys When a document needs to be encrypted, the responsible generates a cryptographically random master key (different from the delegation key, never to appear in clear anywhere in the db. He/she encrypts it using his own AES exchange key and stores it as a delegation
 * @param rev The revision of the invoice in the database, used for conflict management / optimistic locking.
 * @param created The timestamp (unix epoch in ms) of creation of this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param modified The date (unix epoch in ms) of the latest modification of this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param author The id of the User that has created this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param responsible The id of the HealthcareParty that is responsible for this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param medicalLocationId The id of the medical location where this entity was created.
 * @param endOfLife Soft delete (unix epoch in ms) timestamp of the object.
 * @param deletionDate hard delete (unix epoch in ms) timestamp of the object. Filled automatically when deletePatient is called.
 * @param invoiceDate The timestamp (unix epoch in ms) when the invoice was drafted, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param sentDate The timestamp (unix epoch in ms) when the invoice was sent, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param printedDate The timestamp (unix epoch in ms) when the invoice is printed, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param recipientType The type of user that receives the invoice, a patient or a healthcare party
 * @param recipientId Id of the recipient of the invoice. For healthcare party and insurance, patient link happens through secretForeignKeys
 * @param invoiceReference
 * @param thirdPartyReference
 * @param thirdPartyPaymentJustification
 * @param thirdPartyPaymentReason
 * @param reason
 * @param invoiceType The format the invoice should follow based on the recipient which could be a patient, mutual fund or paying agency such as the CPAS
 * @param sentMediumType Medium of the invoice: CD ROM, Email, paper, etc.
 * @param interventionType
 * @param groupId
